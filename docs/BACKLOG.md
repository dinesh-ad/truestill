# truestill - Backlog (approved but unbuilt)

Things that were **decided** but not yet built - captured here so nothing lives only in chat
history. This is not a wishlist of everything possible; only items already agreed, with the
decision context that produced them.

## Approved, not yet built

- **Hash cache (size + mtime keyed).** Approved in the PixSort-extras decision as a re-run
  speedup; never built. mtime is used **only** for change detection, never for date placement
  (that rule is absolute). Today, catalog resume-by-content (`catalog.known_sizes` +
  `seed_rows`) covers re-runs; the cache would additionally skip re-hashing unchanged files
  across runs. Marked convention-not-implemented in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §8.
  - **Reference design:** PixSort `backend/pixsort/utils/hash_cache.py` - a small SQLite table
    keyed on `(filepath, file_size, mtime)` → content digest; a lookup validates the file is
    unchanged (size **and** mtime within ~1s) before trusting the cached digest.
  - **Constraints from the PixSort audit (`PixSort/AUDIT_REPORT.md`):** keep **a single cache
    layer** - never a second parallel store (PixSort's dual-store drift was a defect). Invalidate
    an entry on **size OR mtime mismatch**. **Wire cleanup into the run lifecycle** - PixSort
    *defined* `cleanup_stale_entries()` but **never called it anywhere**, so stale rows
    accumulated forever; truestill must actually invoke pruning as part of a run.
- **GPS-derived per-photo timezone.** Deferred during Takeout Rescue Mode. `--tz` is a single
  fixed offset for the whole run, which cannot correctly date a library that spans timezones;
  the real fix derives each photo's timezone from its GPS. The near-midnight caveat is
  surfaced honestly in the ingest report until this exists.
- **Zip-direct Takeout ingestion.** `truestill ingest --takeout` takes an already-extracted
  directory today; reading the Takeout `.zip`(s) directly was flagged as a follow-up in the
  Phase-2 spec (deferred to avoid complicating v1).
- **Recognize additional real-world video extensions (l).** The metadata-chain corpus surfaced
  container formats truestill's `MEDIA_EXTENSIONS` doesn't recognize, so they are skipped (now
  *reported*, not silent). Recognize the ones that are actually common - **`.vob`, `.ts`, `.m2v`,
  and the `.asf` family at minimum** - with the final list driven by **prevalence evidence, not
  the whole corpus zoo** (`.swf`, raw `.hevc`/`.mjpeg` elementary streams are not "photos to back
  up"). Each extension added must have its **category and date handling verified via the corpus
  probe** before inclusion. **Post-launch, demand-driven.**
## Shipped (kept for provenance)

- ~~**(q) In-place organize (same-device optimization).**~~ **Delivered.** `organize --in-place`
  moves files by atomic rename when source and destination share a filesystem: no bytes
  rewritten, no zero-copy window, hash unchanged because the inode is. Plain `--move` takes the
  same fast path automatically; `--in-place` *requires* it and refuses a cross-device
  destination rather than silently copying. Typed `move` confirmation, mechanism split in the
  report, empty folders left and reported. `truestill undo-organize` ships with it (catalog
  v10, `inplace_runs` + `inplace_moves`) - reversible, not merely resumable. The `Destination.adopt`
  seam is on the interface, so `migrate-layout` can adopt it later without rework.
  **Two landmines found in the build and fixed with it:** `reclaim` would have deleted the only
  copy of an in-place file (source and drive copy are one inode, so its re-verify gate was a
  tautology), and an undo that left `files` rows behind would have made the library
  un-organizable by re-running dedup against itself. Both pinned by tests. See
  `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §1. **App UI deliberately deferred** to CLI soak evidence,
  matching `reclaim`'s CLI-only v1.
  - **Still open:** cloud tier (server-side move within a remote, never via mounts) waits for
    the rclone work; a `--prune-empty-dirs` opt-in waits for soak evidence that the folders
    left behind are actually intolerable.
- ~~**`--skip-undated` on organize/ingest (j).**~~ Delivered: default OFF (undateable files still
  copy to `Undated/`); with the flag, they are skipped as `SKIPPED_UNDATED` and **counted + named**
  in the report - never silent. CLI on organize/ingest, plus an app organize toggle.
- ~~**Space-safe move: source reclamation (k).**~~ Delivered as one verify-gated mechanism, two
  surfaces: `organizer.execute(move=True)` / `organize --move` (copy → record → re-verify → delete,
  `MOVE_KEPT` on failure, no zero-copy window) and `reclaim.run_reclaim` / `truestill reclaim` (dry-run
  default, re-verify-at-delete on a connected drive, typed `delete` confirmation, `--min-copies N`
  with single-copy warning, `reclaim_journal` at schema v9). The copy-only-invariant exception is
  documented in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md §1`. CLI-only in v1 (app surface deferred).

- ~~**Metadata recovery fallback chain - decided on evidence.**~~ A 37-file, 22-format corpus
  test (`docs/metadata-chain-research.md`) showed exiftool already dates every datable file
  (including AVCHD `.mts` and WhatsApp `.mp4`), **no** fallback parser recovered a genuine capture
  date it missed, and naive parsers emit epoch sentinels (1904/1970) that would misfile. Outcome:
  **no parser added**; shipped the never-silent **skipped-file reporting fix** (`scan_source` +
  report); recorded the **sentinel-rejection rule** and ffprobe/schema-v9 reservation as binding
  conventions (`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md §1`). The `CreationDate` UTC-vs-local fix shipped
  earlier (`01ebaa0`). Remaining follow-on tracked as item (l).
- ~~**Event merge/split.**~~ Delivered in the local web UI's Event review screen (merge/split
  are UI-only capabilities the CLI's name/skip flow lacks), exercised end-to-end through the HTTP
  API against real clustered fixtures. The CLI stays name-or-skip only, by design - a terminal is
  the wrong surface for interactively re-partitioning clusters.
- ~~**Configurable organization structure.**~~ Delivered: `LayoutTemplate` seam + token grammar,
  catalog v7 settings (`layout_template`) + validation, `truestill config` with 5 presets and live
  preview, and `truestill migrate-layout` (crash-safe, journaled, catalog v8) plus the app Settings
  screen. Split-era default: a template change affects new files only; migration relocates an
  existing library preview-first. See `docs/org-structure-research.md`.
- ~~**Drive identity + offline catalog + verify.**~~ Delivered: `.vaeon-drive.json` marker,
  catalog v6 (`drives` + `file_copies`), and `truestill drives`/`where`/`verify`/`status`. See the
  CHANGELOG and `docs/drive-identity-research.md`.

## Product / strategy (parked decisions)

> **Settled stance these sit under:** truestill has **no user accounts and no required telemetry,
> permanently**; Pro is gated by **offline-verified license keys, not a login**. Any Pro-tier item
> below inherits that constraint. Full decision + rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D1
> (binding invariant in `IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md §1`).

- **Web dedup teaser.** A Pro-tier positioning idea (a lightweight web-facing "find your
  duplicates" hook); not started. Reference stack proven in PixSort's browser mode, all
  **client-side - nothing is uploaded**: `exifr` (image EXIF), `mediainfo.js` (WASM, video
  dates), `hash-wasm` (BLAKE3 hashing in the browser). PixSort's `lib/metadata.ts` and
  `lib/hash.ts` (present under both `frontend/` and `apps-platform/`) are the reference
  implementations to study when we build this.
- **Desktop UI: Tauri vs local-web.** Parked architecture decision. The Rust-backed Tauri path
  informed the SHA-256/no-BLAKE3 hashing choice; the event-review interaction is the feature
  that will ultimately force the decision.
  - **(o) Lessons from the PixSort audit** (`PixSort/AUDIT_REPORT.md`): whatever wraps the UI,
    **one process serves the real UI**, bound to **loopback only**, and there is **never a second
    framework runtime beside the Python core**. PixSort's Electron+Next.js shell ran a whole JS
    runtime alongside the backend - the coupling and bundle weight it caused is exactly what
    truestill's single-process, server-rendered, no-build local-web UI avoids. A native shell (if ever
    built) wraps that one process; it does not add a second app runtime.

## Ideas / deferred

- **(m) Duplicate-cleanup staging UX.** A **preview → confirm → trash (with restore)** flow for
  removing duplicates - the validated safe-delete pattern (same spirit as `reclaim`'s dry-run +
  typed confirm, but for dedup). Note the real gap PixSort never closed: truestill's near-duplicate
  review still needs a **visual side-by-side compare** (show the two look-alikes at actual pixels
  so a human decides which to keep) - PixSort had no such compare, and a trash-with-restore is
  only trustworthy once the human can actually *see* what they're removing.

  **Binding design constraints, from reviewing PixSort's live duplicate screen:**

  1. **Never auto-select keep/remove by filesystem timestamp.** Observed on real data: PixSort's
     "keep oldest" chose a `(Copy).jpg` to **keep** and the original to **remove**, because the
     mtimes lied - a copy operation had rewritten them. This is the **same lie truestill already
     refuses for dating** (`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §1: "Dating uses an evidence chain, never
     filesystem mtime"). That invariant currently governs *placement* only; item (m) extends the
     identical distrust to **keep/remove selection**, where being wrong is irreversible rather
     than merely untidy. The corpus already contains this exact shape (`scan-a.jpg` + its
     `(Copy)`), so it is testable on day one.
  2. **Rank by evidence, in this order:** embedded capture date → resolution / bitrate →
     original filename pattern (a `(Copy)`/`(1)`/`-kopie` suffix is evidence *against* being the
     original) → catalog provenance (what truestill already recorded about where each copy came
     from). Every one of these is a property of the *file*, not of the filesystem around it.
  3. **Default to NO pre-selection when the evidence is ambiguous.** A pre-ticked checkbox is a
     recommendation the user will accept without reading; if truestill cannot prove which copy is
     the original, it must say so and select nothing. **A reviewed decision, not a trusted
     heuristic** - and never a heuristic wearing a decision's clothes.
  4. **Staged trash-with-restore, never a permanent delete**, with the two actions labelled by
     consequence - **"Recommended"** vs **"Irreversible"** - so the dangerous one is never the
     path of least resistance. Same spirit as `reclaim`'s typed `delete` confirmation.
  5. **Adopt the honest capability notice pattern**: state plainly what the screen can and cannot
     determine, in place, rather than implying more certainty than the evidence supports. This is
     the never-silent rule applied to a UI surface - the existing precedents are the HEIC
     perceptual-skip notice and the Tier A / Tier B date-quality lines.
- **(n) "How your dates were determined" honesty stat — PRIORITIZED for first post-launch.** A
  per-run/library figure in the reports/UI showing the **provenance mix** of capture dates - e.g.
  "82% from embedded EXIF, 11% from filename, 5% from Takeout, 2% Undated" (a metadata-accuracy %).
  truestill already resolves and could persist `date_source` (see the metadata-chain §1b.3 schema-v9
  note); surfacing it honestly tells a user how much to trust their timeline, in truestill's voice.
  - **Validated by the UI-v2 walkthrough:** the organize result's "**N no date → Undated**" line
    confused a first user — a bare count with no way in. It must be **explorable**: click it to see
    *which* files were undated and *why* no date was found (which tags were checked, whether a
    filename date was tried). Same treatment for the provenance mix — each slice drills to its
    files. This is the concrete first slice of (n) to build first post-launch.
- **(p) "Share safely" — metadata-stripping export. PRO TIER (behind the capability seam).**
  A dedicated **export** action that writes cleaned copies for sharing, so a user can post a photo
  without leaking where they live or what device they use. Market demand is documented (a whole app
  category — CleanShots, ExifStrip, etc.; dating / kids / marketplace / forum use cases; email /
  Slack / Telegram-file preserve EXIF). **Design decisions, recorded now:**
  1. **Export-only, never a library operation.** The user selects files; truestill writes cleaned
     copies to a dedicated **share-export folder**. The organized library and the originals keep
     their full metadata, untouched. A strip control anywhere near the library would contradict
     truestill's metadata-preservation identity and invite accidents — it lives only in this export.
  2. **Complete removal, verified.** `exiftool -all=` on the copy (clears EXIF + XMP + IPTC +
     MakerNotes + embedded thumbnails — the thumbnail is the classic leak); for video, an exiftool
     pass **plus** an ffmpeg container rewrite (`-map_metadata -1`, no re-encode) for the
     `uuid`/`udta` boxes; handle **Live Photo** JPEG+MOV pairs together. Then **re-scan each output**
     and produce a verification report ("0 metadata fields remain") — the never-silent rule applied
     to removal. UI states honestly that cleaning affects the *copies*; the originals still exist
     with their metadata (that is the point).
  3. **Folder protection + lineage.** The share-export folder gets a `.truestill-shared.json` marker;
     the scanner **refuses a marked folder as an organize source** with a clear explanation (so
     dateless cleaned copies are never re-swept into `Undated/`). The catalog records lineage
     (cleaned copy ↔ source hash) so dedup never mistakes a stripped copy for a lost original.
  4. **Modes:** **strip-all** (default) and **GPS-only** — the two the market ships.

  Post-launch build; Pro-tier candidate. Research refs to carry in: the embedded-thumbnail trap,
  the XMP/IPTC/MakerNotes layers, MP4 container metadata boxes, and Live Photo pairing.
