# (aag) Near-duplicate grouping and burst review.

*Body of backlog entry `(aag)`, under **Records - evidence, explicitly not work**. The index is [`BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md); the letter namespace is shared with [`SHIPPED.md`](../../SHIPPED.md).*

- **(aag) Near-duplicate grouping and burst review.** Ruled by the maintainer, 2026-07-31, from
  the same gap check. **Record only - do not build.** ⚠ **Overlaps `(m)`**, whose "visual
  side-by-side compare" clause is this item; scope the two together.
  - **This is a review surface over behaviour that is already correct, which is what makes it
    deferrable.** truestill already **keeps** near-duplicates and flags them - `Resolution`
    carries `near_duplicate` and the file is organized anyway, never dropped (`should_upload`
    ignores it), and both surfaces now name what each one resembles and say it was kept. On the
    behaviour the market complains about, truestill is **ahead** of the tools being complained
    about: the complaint is about tools that silently discard.
  - **The distinction that decided the order.** The duplicate-naming payload gap was a **§9
    contract violation** - an outcome counted but not named - and contract violations are not
    deferrable. This is a **feature**: choosing between look-alikes a user can already see
    listed. Same subject, different kind of work, and only one of them was a defect.
  - **Market evidence.** Second most-repeated complaint after the naming one: *"group photos
    that are not quite duplicates, let me pick which to keep"* - burst shots, bracketed
    exposures, near-identical retries.
  - **Open questions for the design pass:** grouping (by perceptual distance, by capture time,
    or both); what "pick which to keep" does given the copy-only invariant, since truestill does
    not delete - it would have to be a *reclaim* offer or a side-bin move, and (§1) constrains
    both; and whether the existing distance threshold is the right grouping key or only the
    right detection key.
