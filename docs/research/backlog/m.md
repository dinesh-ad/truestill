# (m) Duplicate-cleanup staging UX.

*Body of backlog entry `(m)`, under **Ideas / deferred**. The index is [`BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md); the letter namespace is shared with [`SHIPPED.md`](../../SHIPPED.md).*

- **(m) Duplicate-cleanup staging UX.** ⚠ **Overlaps `(aag)`** - the visual side-by-side compare
  described below *is* `(aag)`'s subject. Scope them together or the same review surface gets
  designed twice; `(aag)` also records why it is deferrable (truestill already keeps and flags
  near-duplicates, so it is a review surface over correct behaviour, not a correctness gap).
  A **preview → confirm → trash (with restore)** flow for
  removing duplicates - the validated safe-delete pattern (same spirit as `reclaim`'s dry-run +
  typed confirm, but for dedup). Note the real gap PixSort never closed: truestill's near-duplicate
  review still needs a **visual side-by-side compare** (show the two look-alikes at actual pixels
  so a human decides which to keep) - PixSort had no such compare, and a trash-with-restore is
  only trustworthy once the human can actually *see* what they're removing.

  **Binding design constraints, from reviewing PixSort's live duplicate screen:**

  1. **Never auto-select keep/remove by filesystem timestamp.** Observed on real data: PixSort's
     "keep oldest" chose a `(Copy).jpg` to **keep** and the original to **remove**, because the
     mtimes lied - a copy operation had rewritten them. This is the **same lie truestill already
     refuses for dating** (`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §1: "Dating uses an evidence chain, never
     filesystem mtime"). That invariant currently governs *placement* only; item (m) extends the
     identical distrust to **keep/remove selection**, where being wrong is irreversible rather
     than merely untidy. The corpus already contains this exact shape (`scan-a.jpg` + its
     `(Copy)`), so it is testable on day one.
  2. **Rank by evidence, in this order:** embedded capture date → resolution / bitrate →
     original filename pattern (a `(Copy)`/`(1)`/`-kopie` suffix is evidence *against* being the
     original) → catalog provenance (what truestill already recorded about where each copy came
     from). Every one of these is a property of the *file*, not of the filesystem around it.
  3. **Default to NO pre-selection when the evidence is ambiguous.** A pre-ticked checkbox is a
     recommendation the user will accept without reading; if truestill cannot prove which copy is
     the original, it must say so and select nothing. **A reviewed decision, not a trusted
     heuristic** - and never a heuristic wearing a decision's clothes.
  4. **Staged trash-with-restore, never a permanent delete**, with the two actions labelled by
     consequence - **"Recommended"** vs **"Irreversible"** - so the dangerous one is never the
     path of least resistance. Same spirit as `reclaim`'s typed `delete` confirmation.
  5. **Adopt the honest capability notice pattern**: state plainly what the screen can and cannot
     determine, in place, rather than implying more certainty than the evidence supports. This is
     the never-silent rule applied to a UI surface - the existing precedents are the HEIC
     perceptual-skip notice and the Tier A / Tier B date-quality lines.

  **Quality ranking - the layer that makes the review worth doing (research-grounded).**
  Within each near-duplicate group, rank the candidates by objective quality signals and use
  that ranking to power the side-by-side review's **default suggestion**.

  - **Never auto-action.** Constraint 3 above stands unchanged: a ranking produces a
    *suggestion*, and where the evidence is weak it must still suggest nothing. Ranking makes
    the human's decision cheaper; it does not make it for them.
  - **Why this is the value, from the literature.** Representative-photo-selection and
    burst-quality-assessment work (the PhotoCluster lineage through current blur/quality
    assessment research) consistently finds that in de-duplication and burst review the
    bottleneck is **review effort, not judgement**: people know which photo they want once
    they see the pair, and give up long before they finish looking. A good ranked default is
    therefore the feature -- it turns "review 400 pairs" into "confirm 400 defaults, correct
    a few". Presenting an unranked pile is what makes duplicate review get abandoned.
  - **Signals, cheapest first:** sharpness (Laplacian variance and similar classical focus
    measures), exposure sanity, and resolution -- plus the evidence truestill already has from
    constraint 2: original-vs-recompressed, and the copy-suffix filename pattern as *negative*
    evidence.
  - **Classical metrics first, zero ML dependencies.** They are cheap, explainable in one
    sentence to a user, and defensible in a UI that promises honesty about what it can
    determine. A learned model is only ever a justified later step, against measured
    inadequacy of the simple metrics -- and it would have to earn its dependency against the
    same policy every other dependency does (`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §7).
  - **Positioning:** this is what makes (m) the **Pro-tier crown feature alongside (p)**. The
    safe-delete flow is the table stakes; knowing which copy to keep is the part worth paying
    for.
