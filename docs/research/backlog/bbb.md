# (bbb) exiftool `_original` backups.

*Body of entry `(bbb)`, **CLOSED 2026-09-01**. The closure is in [`SHIPPED.md`](../../SHIPPED.md);
the letter namespace is shared with [`BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md).**Approved - still to build**. The index is [`BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md); the letter namespace is shared with [`SHIPPED.md`](../../SHIPPED.md).*

- **(bbb) exiftool `_original` backups.** Ruled by the maintainer, 2026-07-30. When anyone edits a
  photo's date with exiftool, the default is to leave `file.jpg_original` beside it holding the
  **original** metadata (only `-overwrite_original` skips this).
  - **Safety - Built 2026-07-30.** Measured first: on the default path, `*.jpg_original` was
    already skipped as unrecognized (suffix `.jpg_original`, not `.jpg`). The residual bug was
    `--all-files`, which organized both the live file and the sidecar as near-copies (same
    pixels, different SHA/dates). Fix: `is_exiftool_original_backup` refuses
    `{live_filename}_original` at `scan_source` / `discover` for every caller, including
    `--all-files`. Skipped report uses the plain label **exiftool backup**, not a bare
    `.jpg_original` extension count. Matcher covers any extension (exiftool appends `_original`
    to the full filename). Collision pinned: a legitimate `vacation_original.jpg` ( `_original`
    before the extension) is **not** a backup and is still organized.
  - **Recovery - BUILT 2026-07-31 (step 6), with item 4 PARTIAL.** The offer ships in the rescue
    flow: `date_rescue.original_candidates` finds a ``{name}_original`` beside the recorded
    source, reads its date with the same resolver everything else uses, and offers it **only
    when it parses and differs**. Accepting pre-fills the rescue field; the commit is the same
    typed `confirm_file_date`, so a sidecar date is not a second route into `HUMAN_CONFIRMED`.
    Items 1, 2, 3 and 5 are satisfied as written.

    **Item 4 is one half built and one half DECIDED AGAINST - `(aaj)`, now in *Consciously out
    of scope*.** Verified against code, not assumed:
    - *"the human wins"* - **satisfied, structurally.** `confirm_date` writes
      `captured_at` + `date_source = HUMAN_CONFIRMED`; `migrate` renders from
      `files.captured_at` and `rederive_rules` re-reads metadata for **ambiguous labels only**,
      never dates; `record_uploaded` re-applies a confirmation on re-ingest. All five whole-disk
      operations are pinned by O4 in `test_confirmation_survives.py`.
    - *"note the embedded conflict (never silent)"* - **not built, and not going to be.** The
      only disagreement surfaced anywhere is the **sidecar's**, and only as an offer. Nothing
      compares the live file's embedded EXIF against a confirmation, and `confirm_date` sets
      ``date_tag = NULL`` - so the machine's prior evidence is *discarded*, and the catalog can
      no longer say what the file claimed without re-reading it.

    **Which comparison ships, because the design flagged this as a trap:** against **recorded
    provenance** (`files.captured_at`), never the file's current embedded metadata. After a bake
    the organized copy agrees with the confirmation while the *source* still does not, so
    comparing live metadata would make every rescued file report a conflict with itself forever.
    That trap is avoided - but honestly, it is avoided because the live comparison was never
    built, not because it was built carefully. It was then **decided against** on 2026-07-31,
    once the design showed the only constraint-satisfying route needs a column storing a value
    the system has already ruled wrong; see `(aaj)`. **The trap is recorded there, not open
    here** - and it applies again only if `(aal)` is ever built.

  - **Recovery - original design, kept for provenance** (see **Converged programs**):
    not a parallel `_original` tool. Full design (do not invent a separate surface):
    1. **No silent substitution.** Reading `_original` never auto-wins over the live file's
       embedded date in `resolve_capture_datetime`.
    2. **Same provenance as (ii):** if the user accepts the sibling date, record
       **`human-confirmed`** (highest tier), durable via the date-source column **(n)** and
       **(ii)** share. Machine suggestion only; human commits.
    3. **Same rescue seam:** when the live file has a date *and* a sibling
       `path.name + "_original"` exists with a different parseable capture date, offer a rescue
       candidate on the (ii)/(n) surface ("why this date?" → action). Wording like: "exiftool
       backup beside this file still has 2014-08-17 - use that date?" Confirm → place by
       confirmed date + provenance.
    4. **Disagree visibly:** if live EXIF and `_original` disagree after a human confirm, keep
       human-confirmed; optionally note the embedded conflict (never silent).
    5. **Dedup / identity:** rescue edits the catalog row for the **live** file; `_original`
       stays an unorganized sidecar (never ingested as a second library copy).
    - **Out of scope for recovery:** inventing merges, rewriting live EXIF from `_original`
      without confirm, treating `_original` as a second library citizen.
    - **Sequencing:** recovery UI waits on the (ii)/(n) provenance column - same screen. Safety
      shipped independently so this item is not "untouched".
