- **(y) Optional photo / video split - default TOGETHER, and pair-aware or not at all.**
  Post-layout-correction. An opt-in that separates standalone videos into their own top-level
  branch, leaving photos on the timeline.
  - **The default stays together**, because a chronological timeline is the thing the layout
    correction exists to produce and splitting media types cuts across it. This is a preference,
    not an improvement.
  - ⚠ **The constraint that makes or breaks it: a naive split destroys Live / Motion Photos.**
    An iPhone Live Photo is a **pair** - a `.HEIC`/`.JPG` still plus a `.MOV` sharing a content
    identifier - and a Samsung Motion Photo is the same idea. A split that routes by extension
    sends the still to `Photos/` and its motion half to `Videos/`, silently dismembering an asset
    the user thinks of as one thing. This failure is documented in Apple's own asset model and
    has been reported repeatedly against Immich; it is not hypothetical.
  - **Therefore: the pair moves together, and only a STANDALONE video goes to `Videos/`.** A
    `.MOV` that is the motion half of a Live Photo is not a video for this purpose.
  - **Depends on asset pairing**, which truestill does not have yet - matching a still to its
    motion half (content identifier where present, else name + timestamp + duration heuristics).
    That dependency is the real work; the split itself is a routing branch once pairing exists.
    **Do not build the split first and pair later** - shipping it in that order is shipping the
    dismemberment.
  - Fits the existing router as a third axis (`LayoutScheme` already routes on rule, then on
    evented), so the mechanism is understood; it is blocked on evidence, not on design.
