# (t) Reflink / copy-on-write fast path.

*Body of backlog entry `(t)`, under **Ideas / deferred**. The index is [`BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md); the letter namespace is shared with [`SHIPPED.md`](../../SHIPPED.md).*

- **(t) Reflink / copy-on-write fast path.** On filesystems that support it (APFS, btrfs, XFS,
  ReFS) a clone (`FICLONE` / `clonefile`) makes a copy effectively instant and free.
  **Optimization, not correctness** -- `shutil.copy2` already uses `sendfile`/`fcopyfile` fast
  paths today, so this is a further step rather than a missing one, and newer Python is
  growing stdlib support worth waiting for.
  - ⚠ **Recorded caution, to design against before building:** a clone initially **shares
    blocks with the source**. That interacts directly with the independent-verified-copy story
    -- `copy_sha256` would still verify, because the bytes are identical, but "a second copy"
    that shares extents with the first is not the same thing as an independent one for the
    purposes truestill's custody model claims. Two files on one drive sharing blocks survive
    a `verify` and do **not** survive the block going bad. Decide explicitly what a cloned
    copy means for `file_copies`, for the custody count, and for the at-risk banner **before**
    any of it ships; the honest answer may be that clones are fine within a drive but must
    never count toward 3-2-1 redundancy.
