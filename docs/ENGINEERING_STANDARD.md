# truestill - Engineering Standard (the canon)

Portable principles for working in truestill. This is the *generic* tier. The repo-specific,
checkable rules live in [`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md), which
**wins on any conflict**. Keep this file short: every rule below is one you can actually
violate in *this* repo. If a rule can't be violated here, it doesn't belong here.

truestill is a **local-first CLI/library** heading toward a desktop app. It has no server, no
network API boundary, no untrusted multi-tenant input. Do not import server-SaaS machinery
(pagination, circuit breakers, DTO layers, telemetry stacks, GDPR tooling). Right-size.

## 1. Total cost of ownership

- **Justify every component with a measured need.** A dependency, a table, a layer of
  indirection, a cache - each earns its place by solving a problem you can point at, not one
  you imagine. Written justification lives in the dependency inventory.
- **Reliability over novelty.** Prefer the stdlib and the boring, proven approach. New tech
  needs a reason the old tech can't serve.
- **Defer until a concrete trigger appears.** Don't build the abstraction for the second
  backend until the second backend exists. Leave a seam, not scaffolding.

## 2. The three-phase workflow

**Reconnaissance → Implementation → Verification.** Do them in order; don't blur them.

1. **Reconnaissance.** Read the actual code first. Report truth as `file:line`. No design, no
   edits in this phase - just establish what *is*. Claims about behaviour must be grounded in
   files, never in memory ("I think it does X" is banned; go read it).
2. **Implementation.** Grounded in the research priority order (§3). Make the smallest change
   that is correct. Match the surrounding code's idioms.
3. **Verification.** Run the full gate matrix and report the **exact output**. "Tests pass" is
   not a report; the passing summary line is. If a step is skipped, say so.

**The gate matrix has three layers, and a change is verified at the layer it can break.**

| Layer | Command | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Static | `ruff check` / `ruff format --check` / `mypy` | Style, imports, types |
| Engine | `pytest` (`make check`) | Behaviour: dating, dedup, layout, catalog, custody, safety gates |
| Client | `pytest tests/e2e` (`make e2e`) | What a user actually reads on screen |

The third layer is not optional garnish. It exists because a whole class of defect - the
product describing itself incorrectly - is invisible to the first two, and shipped repeatedly
before it existed. **If a change alters anything a user reads, it is not verified until the
browser lane has run.** Conversely, do not re-assert engine behaviour through a browser: it is
slower, flakier, and already covered. Each layer owns what only it can see.

Two standing rules on that third layer: **no sleeps** (auto-waiting assertions only - hard
waits are the dominant flake source), and **no retries** (a retry-until-green browser suite
launders the nondeterminism the layer exists to expose; a flaky test is quarantined and filed
with its trace).

## 3. Research priority order

When you need to know how something behaves, consult in this order and stop when answered:

1. **Official docs / RFCs / language references.**
2. **Upstream issue trackers & maintainer responses** - especially for tools that already
   fought the battle you're fighting (the failure modes are catalogued there).
3. **Existing patterns in this repo** - reuse the helper that exists; don't duplicate it.
4. **Mature-project practice** - how well-run projects solve it.

Forbidden: asserting library behaviour without verifying it; copying a stale blog pattern;
re-implementing something the repo already has.

## 4. Code standard

- **Idioms (Python 3.13, standard build).** `pathlib` everywhere - never `os.path` string
  joins. `@dataclass(slots=True)` for internal models. `StrEnum` for enumerations. `match`
  for structured dispatch, f-strings, `:=` where it reads better. **Not** pydantic/attrs for
  internal models - truestill has no untrusted-input API boundary, so stdlib dataclasses are the
  right-sized choice. Validation belongs only at real trust boundaries (CLI args, sidecar
  JSON, catalog reads).
- **Typing.** mypy `strict` is mandatory. Full annotations incl. return types; modern syntax
  (`X | None`, `list[str]`, `Self`). No untyped defs. No `type: ignore` without a reason code
  and a comment.
- **Dependencies.** Minimal by principle. Every runtime dep justifies itself against a stdlib
  alternative **in writing**. Lower-bound + lockfile; no blind upper-pins; `uv.lock` is the
  source of truth; updates happen via a periodic `uv lock --upgrade` review.
- **Performance.** Stream files in chunks - never read a whole media file into memory. One
  disk pass per file per run wherever possible. Concurrency via a worker pool for I/O-bound
  batches. No accidental O(n²): any nested iteration over the library carries a comment
  proving its bound.
- **Tests (enrichment over count).** Every feature gets: a happy path, the edge cases the
  research phase surfaced (forum-mined failure modes *are* the test spec), an
  idempotency/re-run test wherever state is touched, and cross-platform-safe assertions
  (compare paths via `.as_posix()`, never `str(Path)`). Prefer fixtures, `parametrize`,
  `tmp_path`, and injected input over TTY. A test that merely restates the implementation is
  not coverage. Test count is never a target - it changes; don't cite it as done-ness.
- **Errors.** Exceptions typed and specific - no bare `except`. User-facing CLI errors are
  actionable sentences, not tracebacks. Every subprocess call checks its return code and
  surfaces stderr on failure. Partial-failure policy: one bad file never aborts a batch - it
  is logged, counted, and reported at the end.

## 5. When to break a rule

Rules bend when the situation demands - but a violation must be **explicit, commented, and
contained.** Write the comment for the next engineer: state *what* rule you're breaking and
*why*, right at the site. The test is simple - a new engineer reads the comment and
understands, with no archaeology. An uncommented deviation is a bug, not a judgement call.
