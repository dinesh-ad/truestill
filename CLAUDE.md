truestill - a local-first media organizer, de-duplicator, and backup pipeline (uv workspace:
`truestill-core` library + `truestill-cli` + `truestill-app`).

The command is `truestill`; the local web UI is `truestill-app`. Drives are identified by a
`.truestill-drive.json` marker (pre-rename `.vaeon-drive.json` drives are still read - see
`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` §3.1).

## Read first, every session - the two-document contract

1. [`docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md`](docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARD.md) - the portable canon.
2. [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md) - the binding,
   repo-specific contract.

**`IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` wins on any conflict.**

Fuller working notes and design rules live in [`docs/CLAUDE.md`](docs/CLAUDE.md).
